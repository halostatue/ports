# halostatue/ports

Experimental new ports and updates for ports that are landing, or ports where I
need to specify override versions that do not currently exist in the MacPorts
index.

I do not promise to keep these updated or even maintain them.

These changes may or may not be contributed to the MacPorts repository.

## Ports

### New Ports

- `devel/chainloop`: An open source software supply chain control plane, a
  single source of truth for artifacts plus a declarative attestation crafting
  process.

- `devel/changie`: A tool to help prepare release changelogs. I am not yet using
  this.

- `devel/diffoci`: diff for Docker and OCI container images

- `devel/git-mediate`: A tool to help with conflict resolution. I have played
  with this and it looks useful, but I haven't yet trained myself out of a
  manual Vim-based conflict resolution flow.

- `devel/git-bug`: A distributed, offline-first bug tracker. Does not currently
  build, if I remember correctly. I haven't looked at this in a while.

- `sysutils/aqua`: A package installer framework. I have not yet been able to
  wrap my head around this one, even though it builds, so I am likely to delete
  this (I don't want to maintain it even if others in the MacPorts community
  find it useful).

### Updated Ports

There are currently no update ports.

### Override Ports

There are currently no override ports.
